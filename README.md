### 🚀 Projects
### 📊 Tableau: [BSR Insurance Employee Analysis](https://github.com/Brianjzh/BSR-Case-Analysis-Tableau) 
Using Tableau I conducted an in-depth analysis of employee retention at BSR Insurance, focusing on factors such as employee level, remote work, age, and salary. Using Tableau, we visualized trends in employee performance, intent to stay, and salary discrepancies. Our findings highlighted key challenges faced by BSR in retaining junior employees and remote workers. We presented recommendations for improving employee retention, including salary adjustments, career development programs, and refining health initiatives.

### 🔍 R Programming: [Airbnb Data Analysis Project](https://github.com/Brianjzh/airbnb-data-analysis)
This project is an in-depth analysis of Airbnb listings and reviews data. Using R and key libraries like `dplyr` and `ggplot2`, I performed data merging, missing data analysis, and statistical testing. The project also explores host acceptance rates, neighborhood trends, and guest satisfaction ratings through data visualization and hypothesis testing.

### 🎥 Python: [Netflix Ratings Analysis by Genre](https://github.com/Brianjzh/netflix-genre-ratings)
This project investigates how the genre of movies and TV shows impacts ratings and popularity votes across platforms like IMDb and TMDb. Using Python and Pandas, I explored genre-specific trends to determine if certain genres are more likely to be successful.
