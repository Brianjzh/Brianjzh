### 🚀 Projects
### 📊 Tableau: [BSR Insurance Employee Analysis](https://github.com/Brianjzh/BSR-Case-Analysis-Tableau) 
Using Tableau I conducted an in-depth analysis of employee retention at BSR Insurance, focusing on factors such as employee level, remote work, age, and salary. Using Tableau, we visualized trends in employee performance, intent to stay, and salary discrepancies. Our findings highlighted key challenges faced by BSR in retaining junior employees and remote workers. We presented recommendations for improving employee retention, including salary adjustments, career development programs, and refining health initiatives.

### 🔍 R Programming: [Capital Bike Share Machine Learning Model](https://github.com/Brianjzh/Capital-Bike-Share-Analysis)
This project applies machine learning techniques to analyze Capital Bike Share data using R. Leveraging the caret package, I built and tuned predictive models to forecast ridership (cnt) based on environmental and seasonal factors. The workflow included data preprocessing, feature engineering with polynomial terms for non-linear relationships, and model evaluation using cross-validation. Key libraries such as dplyr, ggplot2, and broom were used for data manipulation and visualization.

### 🎥 Python: [Netflix Ratings Analysis by Genre](https://github.com/Brianjzh/netflix-genre-ratings)
This project investigates how the genre of movies and TV shows impacts ratings and popularity votes across platforms like IMDb and TMDb. Using Python and Pandas, I explored genre-specific trends to determine if certain genres are more likely to be successful.

### 🎯 What I'm Currently Working On
Diving deep into Business Analysis with a focus on advanced analytics, statistical modeling, and machine learning.
Enhancing my skills in SQL, Python, and R for solving real-world business problems.
Collaborating on projects related to data reporting, cost analysis, and UAT testing for industry roles.
